This was a learning project for me: I wanted to see if I could write a
graphical computer game in Haskell.  The code is probably quite poor in some
places, but I learned many valuable lessons for my next similar project.  For
now, I am using Make to build the project, but hopefully someday I will learn
to use Cabal properly.

The code uses mostly standard Haskell libraries, along with SDL and OpenGL for
the UI and graphics.  As such, it should be very portable, but I have so far
only bothered to make it work on Mac OS X.  I would certainly welcome patches
to make it run on other platforms.
